# Boolean Model for Information Retrieval

This repository contains the implementation of a Boolean Model for Information Retrieval (IR). The Boolean Model is a classical approach to information retrieval that uses Boolean operators such as AND, OR, and NOT to retrieve relevant documents based on queries.

## Features

- Preprocessing of text data
- Building inverted and positional indexes
- Executing boolean/prioximity queries
- Graphical User Interface (GUI) for interaction
- Sample data included for testing and demonstration

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies: Python 3.x, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), Tkinter.
3. Run the Python script `document_query_gui.py`.
4. Interact with the GUI to enter queries, select query types, execute queries, and view the results.

## File Descriptions

- `main.py`: Main Python script containing the implementation.
- `Stopword-List.txt`: Text file containing a list of stopwords used for preprocessing.
- `ResearchPapers/`: Directory containing sample research papers (text files) for indexing and querying.
